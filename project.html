<h2>GenAI declaration and details (list what you used)</h2>
<p>Any use of generative AI must be appropriately acknowledged and include a <a

<p>I acknowledge the use of [1] ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to generate materials that were included within my final assessment in modified form. I entered the following prompts on April 2nd 2025:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can I edit the footer in WordPress editor and not on the page itself?</li>
  <li>I'm looking in Appearance->Themes->MyTheme(I pressed the customized button for it) and there's no option
    for a footer, is there a setting I need to change</li>
  <li>No im creating my own custom theme</li>
  <li>In a previous conversation these were the steps you gave me:
    1. Set Up Basic Footer in Theme
    2: Add Footer Widgets (Optional)
    3: Add Customizer Options for Footer Text (Basic Customization)
    4: Add Custom Footer Background Color (Optional)</li>
  <li>When I add a paragraph section via the widgets editor the text appears outside the footer
    (I can tell because it has no grey background around it like the rest of the footer)</li>
  <li>In this section of code: "footer code to display footer" how do I get the website title</li>
  <!-- Footer Code To Display Footer: <p>&copy; <?php echo date('Y'); ?> My Custom Theme</p> -->
</ul>
<p>I acknowledge the use of [1] ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to generate materials that were included within my
  final assessment in modified form. I entered the following prompts on April 8th 2025:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I have a cloud access website for my staging server. I will also be using a separate cloud access server for my
    production server. I have been developing a custom theme in WordPress and deploying my theme to the staging server
    via GitHub Actions  (it also uses the Sam Kirkland FTP-Deploy-Action. I need to be able to manually approve for my
    custom theme and the database of the staging server to be deployed to the production server. Here is the code for
    my local to staging. Remember, I am going from staging to production:

    "code for deployment.yml here for brevity"


    I would also like to ensure that the local to staging and staging to production should be in separate files.
  </li>
  <li>are there other methods for notification? for example ia github?</li>
  <li>tell me more about the github issues</li>
  <li>so how do I create a github issue to be approved in this</li>
</ul>
<p>A similar conversation on the same day (April 8th) using the same first prompt</p>
<ul>
  <li>cloud access does not support ssh on my current plan</li>
  <li>how do I use a WordPress plugin in my automated workflow</li>
  <li>do I need to install the plugin before I run this workflow action or will it install the plugin automatically?</li>
  <li>wp plugin install wp-migrate-db --activate --path=./httpdocs
    shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
    /home/runner/work/_temp/22cf9375-862b-4657-958d-32585be8eb4f.sh: line 1: wp: command not found
    Error: Process completed with exit code 127.</li>
