### Theme design
We wanted to create a simplistic, modern and a sleek website.
The color palate for the website was based off of the site logo.
The site uses sans-serif font which makes site content easy to read and scan.
The headings and text on the site are written appropriately with different colors and sizes
that fit the overall theme of the website.
All links are clearly styled to indicate interactivity,
using appropriate colors to enhance accessibility.
