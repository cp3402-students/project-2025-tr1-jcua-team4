# CP3402 Group Project - Team 4

Welcome to our project repository!  
This repository contains the source code and documentation for **project-2025-tr1-jcua-team4**, where we developed a custom WordPress website for **Baizonn Learning Center**. The aim of this project was to increase parent engagement and student enrollment by creating a modern, user-friendly site using a custom WordPress theme built on the Underscores (_s) starter theme.

## About the Underscores Theme

The **Underscores theme** (also known as `_s`) is a lightweight starter theme developed by Automattic. It provides a clean and minimal foundation for building custom WordPress themes. With semantic HTML5 markup and well-organized code, it's ideal for developers who want full control over a theme’s design and functionality.
