___
Welcome to our project.
This repository contains the source code and documentation for project-2025-tr1-jcua-team4.
In this project,
a new website was created for Bazillion Learning Center to increase the number of parents
enrolling their students at the Baizonn learning center.
A custom theme was used for the site using the Underscores WordPress theme template.

### Underscores theme
The Underscores theme (also known as _s) is a lightweight starter theme developed by Automattic, designed to provide a clean and minimal foundation for building custom WordPress themes. It includes essential template files, semantic HTML5 markup, and well-organized code, making it an ideal starting point for developers who want full control over the design and functionality of their themes.
